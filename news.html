<p class="big">Harvest Festival and Earth Day
Harvest Festival (held just before Thanksgiving) and Earth Day provide opportunities for students to get together in cross-divisional “cluster family” groups that work together on community service, team-building activites and theme-related projects. 

Harvest Festival projects frequently involve craft-making, with hand-made items going to local hospitals or senior center ; letter-writing to government officials in support of legislation; food pantry collections; and fundraising to support disaster relief organizations and non-profit organizations.

Earth Day typically focuses on projects related to the environment and sustainability, though team-building activities are also central to the day's events.</p>
