        <h1>Aeroponic Tower Garden</h1>

      <div class="news">
        <p class="big">Students in the Middle School Sustainability Club are growing and harvesting greens and herbs for Calhoun's lunch program using a new aeroponic tower garden that "lives" in the seventh-floor science lab.

The tower is a self-contained, closed system that uses about 20 gallons of water (none wasted) and doesn't require soil or sun—though the new full-spectrum growing lights are definitely contributing to the growing tower's efficiency. As many as 20 plants can be planted at one time and ready for harvest in as little as 21 days.

Lower Schoolers are contributing to the project by nurturing the seedlings for the tower garden. Middle Schoolers are planting the seedlings in the tower garden, testing the water acidity to ensure the correct pH factor, and harvesting the plants; already, they have provided a healthy batch of basil, kale, arugula, bib lettuce and other greens to our food service program!

David Hyman, the MS club's supervisor and co-coordinator of sustainability at Calhoun, says he hopes to get at least three to ten more towers. But for now, he's thrilled about the way the Middle School students are taking charge of the tower garden and even more optimistic about the opportunities it's creating for cross-divisional cooperation.

    <p class="big">Roles were reversed in the South Bronx on May 29, 2014, as five members of the Middle School Sustainability Club traded in their “student” hats for better-fitting “expert” caps. They were tasked with helping second graders at Family Life Academy Charter School (FLACS II) build an aeroponic tower garden of their own.

The students at FLACS II, a partner school of Calhoun’s, welcomed Matthew Glimcher ’19, Oscar Llodra ’20, Katie Draeger ’20, Sam Draeger ’20, Sydney Clarke ’21 and sustainability coordinator David Hyman with open arms—literally, for hugs—and were eager to get working. What ensued was an inspiring morning of experiential learning and community building.

“I can't even begin to express how proud I am of our kids,” says David. “As ambassadors for the school and for the sustainability work we’re doing, our kids left a positive and lasting impression on the second graders at FLACS II and represented Calhoun in the best possible way.” For their efforts this year, the Sustainability Club was honored with a Special Service Award, given to a student or group that demonstrates a special commitment to the greater good of the Calhoun community.

The tower garden was up and running in less than two hours, and—thanks to Calhoun’s second graders—the FLACS II students had seedlings ready to place in it. Even after the Sustainability Club departed, the FLACS kids were buzzing. “We walked back up to the classroom and they could not stop talking about the amazing experience they’d had,” says Jennifer Kennedy, a teacher at FLACS II. “One of my students said, ‘They really were experts!’ It’s true. Your students were so knowledgeable, kind and patient; some of them seemed like future teachers!” Adds Kathy Ortiz, assistant principal at FLACS II, “One of my students came up to me and said, ‘I love them, Ms. Ortiz. I want them to come back and eat salad!’”

For the Sustainability Club, it was an equally enriching experience. “Seeing the happiness that we caused was inspiring, and it makes me want to do something even bigger,” says Oscar. “It made me feel really good, making these new friends while doing something to help the environment.”

“Heading into the FLACS visit, I felt like I didn’t have an incredible amount of knowledge to share, but I quickly realized that wasn’t the case,” says Katie. “It was amazing to be relied upon, and I felt so smart when they asked questions and I was able to answer them. I’ve always admired people who have visited our school to talk about different subjects, so to flip it over and be one of those people is really cool.”</p>
